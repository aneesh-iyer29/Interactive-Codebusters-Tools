# Interactive-Codebusters-Tools
Various html/css/js embeds that create interactive tools to provide live feedback on problems. 

Each file contains the source code for a different type of cipher that is used in the Codebusters event in the 2025-2026 season. Edit the variables with the specific information for your question and the program will format it for you. Once solved, the program will display a keyword (which can be any string of text that you wish to display to the user once they have solved the question).

This code was originally used for ScioVirtual Advanced Codebusters 2025, and a website containing ~100 practice questions using this code can be found here: https://sites.google.com/view/sciovirtualcodebusters/home
